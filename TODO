Known issues: 
--The kernel interface is unsafe.  The reading of ELF files in the program 
  loader does not completely sanitize input.  Additionally, the kernel call 
  UART_WRITE(As of writing this, the only kernel call implemented), does 
  not sanitize inputs.  It will read from any memory address.

TODO: 
--Current functionality is extremely limited and certain parts may need re-designing 
  as the current structure does not seem to be as clean as I would like.
--I have just finished getting the ablity to load and run a userspace program working.  
  I need to do extensive clean up and documentaion in the code.
